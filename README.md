# Client Server Architecture

Welcome to the Client-Server Architecture repository! This project explores fundamental concepts of client-server
communication, covering key topics such as network protocols, sockets, request-response mechanisms, and data exchange.
It includes practical examples demonstrating how clients and servers interact over TCP/IP, along with insights into HTTP
and other common protocols. A great resource for understanding how distributed systems communicate efficiently over
networks.
